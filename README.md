# Branching-Fanfiction-Platform
**Status:** Seeking volunteer developers and designers! (Open Source, No Budget)
I am 27 years old and extremely autistic other things that make me feel terrible.

I for one love Wattpad, Fanfiction.net and Archive of our own.

I have an account on all 3 famous fanfic sites.

I have no web designing or developing experiences, but I always wanted to be successful in a hobby to create a new fanfiction site.

For anyone who reads this hobby assignment, Please be nice.

I’m passionate about working with Developers & Designers to create a free, interactive fanfiction website where readers and writers can explore branching stories, fork existing narratives, and collaboratively expand on each other’s ideas. My vision merges the best features of platforms like writing.com and Fiction Branches as well with a focus on fanfiction: rich, creative, and community-driven storytelling. As a non-commercial project, I’m seeking volunteer collaborators who share enthusiasm for fan communities, open collaboration, and interactive narrative formats.

My goal is to help build and be a founder or co-owner of a web platform where each story can branch out: readers and authors can choose different paths, fork into new threads, and continue where prior authors left off. The result is a multi-author mosaic of creative universes. Think of it as a tree-like conversation in prose, centered around fanfiction fandoms—completely free to use, with all content licensed under an open‑source or Creative Commons model. I always wanted to be a founder of a website idea, Co-owner or anything special in the history of Fanfiction.

I’m looking for:

Web developer(s) experienced with backend logic to support branching/forks, versioning, user accounts, and collaborative writing.

Designer or UI/UX collaborator to create a clean, inviting front-end interface that works well on desktop and mobile.

Optional but welcome: community/UX support for moderator tools, layout guidelines, or governance frameworks.

This is a hobby project: no budget, no paid contractors—instead, this is a creative, open‑source opportunity for developing portfolio work, collaborating on meaningful tech/design, and building something unique for fanfiction communities. The idea appeals to developers and designers who want a real, visible contribution to creative storytelling platforms.

I envision this as a flexible contribution model:

You go at your own pace.

Why Volunteer & How I Learned the Hard Way

Two years ago, I hired someone off Reddit to build a platform with branching fanfiction features—thinking it was a paid gig—but unfortunately it turned into a scam, costing several thousand dollars with no working product. I’ve learned the importance of transparency, trust, and open collaboration. That’s why I’ve decided to pursue this as a volunteer open source project, so that contributors can evaluate progress in real time via GitHub and community channels, and no money exchanges hands.

My experience makes me extra cautious, but also determined to build a more trustworthy and community-oriented space. If you’re interested, I’ll openly share past lessons and ensure every step is documented and visible to contributors.

Why This Platform Matters

Fanfiction communities thrive on remix culture, shared worlds, and collaboration. Yet most platforms focus only on linear storytelling. Branching platform tools are rare, and those that exist aren’t designed for genres like fanfiction specifically. I want to give fans—writers and readers—a creative space where expanding and reinterpreting stories is not only allowed, but encouraged.

Interested? Here’s How to Get Involved

Please comment below or send me a DM if:

You’re a web developer comfortable with branching logic and backend work

A little about your background

Thank you for reading and considering being part of this creative journey. I want to build something that empowers fanfiction communities, celebrates collaborative storytelling, and does so without financial risk to either party. Your talent—whether coding, design, or planning—can make this platform a home for creative branches yet untold.

Let’s build something extraordinary—together!

Not for money, but for free fun!

Nick
